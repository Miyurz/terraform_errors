#2. Error putting S3 replication configuration: InvalidRequest: Destination bucket must be in a different region than source bucket.  

Possible Fix: Check if your destination bucket is in the same region as the replication one. If so, you may want to change it.
              - Run a tf destroy if tf apply doesn't work out[It worked in my case]. Eg: tf destroy --auto-approve
